Jaeryeong Choe (Jae) Interactive Media path
I'm interested in UX/UI design, 3D graphics, and Web-design.
I don't have any web development experience before getting into TAMK. 
Introduction to programming and webtool course in TAMK are my first learning experience about computer programming and web development.
I want to be web-designer or UX/UI designer or Game designer.
Many times while programming, I don't even know what exactly I'm doing ;-;...
